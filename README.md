Collection of Jupyter notebooks and python scripts for analyzing and visualizing E3SM and SP-E3SM model output

## cmclimate
These utilities use the cmclimate package (https://github.com/serazing/cmclimate; DOI: https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/123413406).
In the current version I've simply copied the ``cmclimate'' subdirectory from the referenced repository -- when I learn to do this a 
better way, I will update accordingly.
